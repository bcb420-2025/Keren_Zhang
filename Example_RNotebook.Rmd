This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

Task:
Use your image to create a basic RNotebook that does the following-
- create a 5 by 10 matrix of random integers
- define column names as cond1, cond2, cond3, cond4, cond5, ctrl1, ctrl2, ctrl3, ctrl4, ctrl5
- define row names as gene1, gene2, gene3 ...
- Compute the fold change for each gene.

```{r}
# Set seed for reproducibility
set.seed(420)

# Create a 5x10 matrix of random integers
example_matrix <- matrix(sample(1:100, 50, replace = TRUE), nrow = 5, ncol = 10)

# Define Column Names
colnames(example_matrix) <- c("cond1", "cond2", "cond3", "cond4", "cond5", "ctrl1", "ctrl2", "ctrl3", "ctrl4", "ctrl5")

# Define Row Names
rownames(example_matrix) <- c("gene1", "gene2", "gene3", "gene4", "gene5")

# View Matrix
example_matrix

# Compute Fold Change
# Calculate fold change: average of conditions / average of controls
fold_change <- apply(example_matrix, 1, function(x) {
  mean(x[1:5]) / mean(x[6:10])
})

# Print fold change
fold_change
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
